        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p id="summary">
            I am a classically trained engineer and my computer savvy has been a
            huge boon throughout my career. I am passionate about taking it to
            new heights by becoming the best software engineer I can be. I cut
            my teeth in the construction industry working with others to lead
            large teams of technical and non-technical personnel and I have a
            hands on approach to life that prepares me to work my way up on this
            new path. I am confident that the soft skills I have honed by
            working with others, often through difficult situations, will allow
            me to integrate smoothly on a new team.
